# ORB Algorithm

This repository demonstrates the implementation and usage of the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) algorithm for feature detection and description in images.

## What is ORB?
ORB is a fast and efficient alternative to SIFT and SURF algorithms for feature detection, with lower computational cost. It combines FAST keypoint detector and BRIEF descriptor with some enhancements.

## Features
- Feature detection using ORB
- Keypoint matching between images
- Example images for testing the algorithm

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library

### Installation
Install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
