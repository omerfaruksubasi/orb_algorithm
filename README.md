# ORB Algorithm

This repository demonstrates the implementation and usage of the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) algorithm for feature detection and description in images.

## What is ORB?
ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) is a fast and efficient algorithm used in computer vision to detect and describe keypoints in images. ORB was developed as a free and efficient alternative to more complex algorithms like SIFT and SURF, with lower computational cost.

## Key Features
- **Speed:** ORB is significantly faster than SIFT or SURF, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Rotation Invariance:** ORB handles image rotation effectively, thanks to its use of oriented keypoints.
- **Binary Descriptors:** ORB uses binary descriptors, which are computationally efficient and easy to compare.

## How ORB Works:
1. **Keypoint Detection:** ORB uses the FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) algorithm to detect corners in an image.
2. **Descriptor Extraction:** ORB uses the BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features) algorithm to generate binary descriptors.
3. **Orientation Compensation:** ORB adds orientation compensation to BRIEF, making it more robust to image rotation.

This image shows how the ORB algorithm detects keypoints in an example image, with each keypoint marked as a circle.

## Why Use ORB?
ORB is ideal for situations where speed is crucial, such as mobile applications, real-time object tracking, or when working with large datasets of images. It's a very efficient algorithm that balances accuracy with computational performance.

## Installation
To use the ORB algorithm in your project, make sure you have Python 3.x and OpenCV installed. You can install OpenCV with the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
